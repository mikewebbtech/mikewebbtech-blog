title: Introduction to Cyber Incident Response Plan
summary: A Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) is needed to transform an organisation's approach to security incidents from panic to preparedness. It provides a structured playbook  for preparing, detecting, responding to, and recovering from a cybersecurity events.  A CIRP provides clear responsibilities and procedures, minimising harm and accelerating recovery.  Its value is in creating coordinated action in high-pressure situations, preventing disorganisation, and reducing the downtime, costs, and reputational damage that can result from a breach.

# Cyber Incident Response Plan

### Turn Panic to Preparedness

When it comes to cyber security, the question is not *if* an incident will occur but *when*. This is just the reality of not only hosting or access services online, but just simply being being online.

A Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) establishes a plan to prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from incidents when they arise. By documenting clear responsibilities and procedures, a CIRP creates coordinated action, minimising harm and accelerating recovery at a time when chaos can overwhelm the team responding.

#### The Value of a CIRP

Organisations without a plan usually respond reactively, in a disorganised and error-prone manner. The absence of a plan increases downtime, costs, and reputational risk. A CIRP addresses this by ensuring that:

- Incidents are identified quickly and acted upon before escalation.
- Teams understand assigned responsibilities, reducing confusion in high-pressure situations.
- Internal and external communication follows a defined pathway.
- Recovery procedures are documented, repeatable, and continuously improved.

In addition to strengthening operational resilience, a CIRP supports compliance with frameworks such as the **Essential Eight** and the **Information Security Manual (ISM)**. More importantly, it provides a practical playbook that bridges strategic planning and operational execution.

#### Core Phases of a Cyber Incident Response Plan

Response plans typically follow six interconnected phases:

#### Preparation:

- Define the incident types covered (phishing, ransomware, malicious or accidental actions).
- Establish an Incident Response Team (IRT) with clear roles (with backups to fill in).
- Set communication and escalation pathways.
- Conduct training, awareness, and simulation exercises.

#### Identification:

- Detect anomalies through monitoring tools, log analysis, or user reporting.
- Classify incidents by severity and business impact. (e.g. A single compromised user account may be classified as low severity, whereas ransomware affecting payment systems represents a critical incident.)

#### Containment:

- Apply short-term actions such as isolating affected systems.
- Implement longer-term strategies, including network segmentation or enhanced monitoring.
- Containment serves as a barrier, preventing disruption from spreading further into the organisation.

#### Eradication:

- Remove the root cause, including malicious software, compromised credentials, or misconfigurations.
- Apply relevant security updates and revoke access where necessary.

#### Recovery:

- Restore systems from verified backups.
- Monitor carefully for reinfection indicators.
- Restore services in a controlled, staged approach to avoid reintroducing vulnerabilities.

#### Lessons Learned:

(After action debriefs )

- Conduct a structured review to evaluate the effectiveness of the response.
- Update security policies, technical controls, and awareness programs.
- Feed findings directly into CIRP revisions to improve readiness for future incidents.

#### Communication and Coordination

Incident response plans not only requires technical responses and measures but also need to incorporate a clear communication plan. An effective CIRP should define:

- Reporting mechanisms (e.g. hotline, ticketing systems).
- Responsibilities for communicating with regulators, employees and customers Especially if there are regulatory reporting requirements or the impact potentially extends customers or business partners.
- Rules governing what information is shared, how, and when.

Clear communication prevents misinformation, ensures compliance with reporting obligations, and protects organisational partners and reputation.

#### Testing and Continuous Improvement

A CIRP is only as effective if it s practice and refinement. This can include:

- **Tabletop exercises:** scenario-based, dry run walkthroughs and discussions that test decision-making.
- **Red team/blue team exercises:** adversarial simulations that stress-test procedures under realistic conditions. (consultants)
- **Periodic reviews:** annual updates to reflect evolving threats, technology changes, or business priorities.

Even limited testing, such as a one-hour tabletop exercise, can reveal weaknesses that remain hidden during daily operations.

#### Integration the Cybersecurity Strategy

An incident response plan does not operate in isolation. It a pillar in the organisations broader security framework. In the **Essential Eight**, the CIRP supports recovery and detection controls, ensuring technical defences are matched with operational readiness. As well as the **ISM** by providing the formal requirements for incident response processes

Integration with these frameworks contribute to and demonstrates a strategic maturity level and improves resilience against evolving cyber threats.

#### Where to Start?

A practical starting point in developing or strengthening a CIRP, organisations often focus first on:

- Assigning an incident response coordinator.
- Establishing a single reporting channel for suspected incidents.
- Documenting the most likely incident types based on business risks.
- Scheduling an initial tabletop exercise with key stakeholders.

These steps provide a foundation that a more comprehensive, continuously improved plan can be developed.

A Cyber Incident Response Plan is more than a static document; it is a structured process that equips organisations to face cyber threats head-on. Through preparation, detection, containment, recovery, and review, a CIRP ensures that incidents are met with a swift, coordinated, and effective response.

When properly integrated into broader cybersecurity strategies, a CIRP supports compliance and ensures that critical operations can resume faster and continue in the face of inevitable cyber incidents.
