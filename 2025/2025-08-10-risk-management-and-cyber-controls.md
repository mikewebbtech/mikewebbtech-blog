### Risk Management and Cyber Controls: From Gaps to Implementation

After identifying your assets and understanding the threats and risks they face, the next step is to build and implement a robust defences.   This  moves from theory to practice, focusing on how to establish a solid risk management framework and then select and implement the right cyber security controls to close the security gaps identified in your assessments.  It’s about creating a living, breathing strategy that protects your organisation from  digital threats.

### Risk Management Framework and Cyber Risk Controls

A **risk management framework** is a structured approach to managing risk, designed to provide a consistent and effective way to identify, assess, and treat risks across an organisation.  These frameworks are guided by the principle that risk management should be integrated into an organisation’s decision-making process, rather than being a separate, isolated activity. The goal is to reduce risk level to as low as reasonably practicably (*ALARP*) , ensuring that the processes implemented provide a clear benefit to the organisation.

A key component of this framework is the implementation of **cyber risk controls**. These are actions, processes, or technologies used to reduce security risks.  They are a direct response to the threats and vulnerabilities identified during the risk assessment.  Controls can be categorised based on their function:

- **Preventative:** Aimed at stopping an incident before it happens, such as fire safety training.
- **Detective:** Designed to identify an incident as it occurs, like smoke alarms.
- **Corrective:** Focused on restoring a system after an incident, such as a property insurance policy to recover from fire damage.

### Select and Implement Cyber Security Controls

The selection and implementation of controls is a deliberate process that begins with understanding your organization's specific needs and its risk appetite.

 ####  1. Identify Security Gaps

Before implementing new controls, you must first identify the gaps between your current security posture and your desired level of protection. A 

**security gap analysis** is a formal review of your current network security policies, procedures, and measures to pinpoint weaknesses and areas that are not compliant with industry regulations. This process is vital for several reasons:

- It helps you identify where you are failing to meet your cybersecurity requirements.
    
- It can help you avoid regulatory and compliance issues before they result in official sanctions.
    
- It allows you to consolidate redundant security measures that may be interfering with business operations.
    
- It raises awareness about cybersecurity best practices among employees.
    

#### 2. Determine Cyber Controls

Once the gaps are identified, you can determine which controls are most appropriate to address them. This selection process is directly linked to the organisation's **risk appetite level**, the level of risk it is willing to accept.

> The goal is to find controls that effectively address the gaps while aligning with the organisation's business objectives.

For example, a security control might be a standard operating procedure (SOP) that outlines how to manage backups and user accounts, or an incident response plan (IRP) that provides guidelines for what constitutes a cyber incident.

####  3. Seek Feedback and Agree on Cyber Security Controls

A critical but often overlooked step is to seek feedback from key organisational representatives (*The end user*) and gain their agreement on the chosen controls. This collaborative approach ensures that the controls are practical and do not hinder business processes. Feedback is essential for:
- Identifying discrepancies between the proposed controls and the actual cybersecurity requirements.
- Ensuring the controls are a good fit for the organisation's culture and operational "reality".
- **Gaining buy-in from stakeholders, which is critical for successful implementation.**

Effective risk and service management is a continuous cycle of 
- **Analysis**, 
- **Implementation**, and 
- **Review**. 

By establishing a robust framework, identifying and closing security gaps, and strategically implementing cyber controls with input from across the organization, you can build a resilient defense. The journey from identifying a threat to implementing a control is a testament to an organization's commitment to protecting its most valuable assets—its data, its operations, and its reputation.
