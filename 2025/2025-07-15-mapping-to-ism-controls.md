# Mapping Essential 8 Strategies to ISM Controls

The Essential Eight provides a progressive baseline of strategies for organisations to adopt in achieving a desired cybersecurity maturity level. The Information Security Manual (ISM) is a detailed framework of security controls that guide in implementing these strategies.  By mapping the Essential Eight to the ISM principles and controls, organisations have a structured, standards-based approach in achieving maturity level targets and improving thier security posture.  

This approach delivers three key benefits:

- **Progression**: Organisations have guidance on how to mature from ad-hoc security to structured, measurable practices.
- **Alignment**: Mapping to recommended controls ensures Essential Eight strategies are not standalone but integrated into broader security framwork.
- **Outcomes driven improvement**: Organisations move beyond “ticking a box” to effective, prioritised and measurable evidence of compliance their own plan.

#### What does this look like?


## Example Mapping: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

|**Maturity Level**|**Essential Eight MFA Focus**|**Aligned ISM Controls**|
|---|---|---|
|**Level 0**|No MFA implemented.|No relevant ISM controls applied.|
|**Level 1**|MFA enabled for remote access to email and VPN.|ISM controls on _remote access_ and _authentication requirements_.|
|**Level 2**|MFA extended to privileged accounts.|ISM controls on _administrative access management_ and _identity assurance_.|
|**Level 3**|MFA applied comprehensively across all users, systems, and applications.|ISM controls requiring _strong, multi-layered authentication mechanisms_ across environments.|

## Additional Examples

### Patch Applications

|**Maturity Level**|**Essential Eight Patch Applications Focus**|**Aligned ISM Controls**|
|---|---|---|
|**Level 0**|Applications not patched or updates not managed.|No patch management controls applied.|
|**Level 1**|Security patches for internet-facing applications applied within 2 weeks.|ISM controls on _vulnerability management_ and _system patching timelines_.|
|**Level 2**|Security patches for all applications applied within 2 weeks.|ISM controls on _application security maintenance_ and _change management_.|
|**Level 3**|Patches tested, validated, and deployed rapidly (within 48 hours if needed).|ISM controls requiring _continuous vulnerability management_ and _risk-based prioritisation_.|

### Restrict Administrative Privileges

|**Maturity Level**|**Essential Eight Admin Privilege Focus**|**Aligned ISM Controls**|
|---|---|---|
|**Level 0**|Users have unnecessary admin rights.|No restrictions enforced.|
|**Level 1**|Admin privileges restricted to some users, with limited oversight.|ISM controls on _basic access restrictions_ and _user role management_.|
|**Level 2**|Privileged accounts strictly controlled, logged, and reviewed.|ISM controls on _privileged access management_, _system integrity monitoring_, and _audit logging_.|
|**Level 3**|Just-in-time admin access with strong MFA and continuous monitoring enforced.|ISM controls requiring _strong authentication_, _separation of duties_, and _real-time monitoring_.|

## Why This Matters

These tables illustrate the **progressive nature** of the Essential Eight. Each strategy begins with basic implementation (Level 1) and builds toward comprehensive maturity (Level 3). By aligning each level to ISM controls, organisations gain a repeatable method for tracking progress, demonstrating compliance, and prioritising investment.

Mapping the Essential Eight to ISM controls bridges high-level strategy with detailed technical and governance requirements. It helps organisations progress maturity in a measurable way, ensures alignment with national standards, and reinforces that security is not a one-off project but a continual improvement journey.

This structured, outcome-focused mapping transforms cybersecurity from reactive firefighting into proactive resilience building.
