####  Essential Eight Maturity Levels

The Essential Eight framework defines four maturity levels, which allow organisations to progressively implement the strategies based on their risk appetite. A key goal is to achieve a consistent maturity level across all eight strategies.

- **Maturity Level Zero:** This level indicates significant weaknesses and a lack of alignment with any of the Essential Eight controls. An organisation at this level is vulnerable to basic cyber threats.
- **Maturity Level One:** This level is focused on defending against basic, opportunistic threats, such as those that use phishing, reused credentials, or unpatched systems. It requires an organisation to have implemented some of the baseline controls.
- **Maturity Level Two:** At this level, an organisation has implemented controls that are effective against more targeted and capable threats. This includes enhanced defenses for better protection against sophisticated cyber-attacks.
- **Maturity Level Three:** This is the highest level, designed to defend against adaptive, persistent, and more advanced threats. An organisation at this level demonstrates a robust and resilient security posture.

The provided documents mention that a registered training organisation is required to meet Maturity Level Two to ensure the confidentiality of student information.

#### **Mapping Essential Eight Strategies to ISM Controls**

The Essential Eight is not a standalone solution; it complements other frameworks and manuals like the ISM. The ISM provides a comprehensive catalog of information security controls. To achieve a desired Essential Eight Maturity Level, an organization can map its chosen strategies to the specific controls outlined in the ISM. This provides a clear, structured way to implement and track progress toward a more resilient security posture.

For example, achieving a higher maturity level for the "Multi-Factor Authentication" strategy would involve progressively implementing MFA more thoroughly across the organisation. This disciplined approach ensures that security controls are not just in place, but that they are actively tested, refined, and demonstrated to deliver real protection.


The Essential Eight provides a clear and actionable roadmap for organizations to improve their cyber resilience. By understanding and progressively implementing the strategies across the maturity levels, businesses can proactively defend against a wide range of cyber threats. This framework, supported by detailed guidance from the ACSC and complemented by the ISM, empowers organizations to build a dynamic and effective security posture that adapts to an ever-changing threat landscape.
