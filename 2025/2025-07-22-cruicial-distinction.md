# Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks
## A Crucial Distinction

In cybersecurity, the terms **threats, vulnerabilities,** and **risks** are often used interchangeably, but they are distinct concepts.  Understanding their relationship is fundamental to building an effective security program.   Also important that these concepts have a context, namely they relate to *assets*.  Think of it as a logical chain: a **threat** exploits a **vulnerability** to create a **risk**.

### What are They?

- **Threat**: A threat is the *actor* or *event* with the potential to cause harm, such as a hacker, a piece of malware, or even a natural disaster like a fire.  A potential danger that may exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm. A threat is not an event itself, but rather the potential for an event to occur.
    
    > **Example:** A malicious hacker, a piece of malware, or a natural disaster like a fire are all considered threats.
    
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness, flaw, or gap in a system, process, or control that a threat can exploit.  Weak access controls, human error, and outdated policies are just as much vulnerabilities as a software bug.
    
    > **Example:** An unpatched software bug, a weak password, or a lack of employee security training are all vulnerabilities.
    
- **Risk**: The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. Risk is a measure of both the likelihood of a threat occurring and the consequences or the impact becoming real.
    
    > **Formula:** Risk = (Likelihood of a threat event) x (Impact of that event)
    

> [!ABSTRACT]
> **risk** has two components: **likelihood** and **impact**.  Likelihood is the probability of a threat event occurring, while impact measures the potential damage or loss if it does.  By assessing both an understand of a risk can be calculated and controls prioritised.

#### Laying it out for the layman

I best heard this explained in the context of how we approach home security.  
Imagine a house....and what assets, threats, vulnerabilities and risks exists.

- The **asset** are the valuables,
- The **threat** is a burglar,
- The **vulnerability** is an unlocked window on the ground floor,
- The **risk** is that the burglar will enter through the unlocked window and steal valuables.

If you lock the window (address the vulnerability), the risk is mitigated.  Similarly, if there are no burglars in the area (no immediate threat), there is no risk, even with an unlocked window.  Cyber security is managing this relationship by reducing vulnerabilities and mitigating threats to lower the overall risk.
